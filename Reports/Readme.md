# Itunes-Podcast-Chart-Analysis
This repo uses R to analyze and visualize itunescharts.net data by picking specific podcasts of interest.  First analysis is on 'Crooked Media'.

I'll let you in on a secret... I love podcasts!
Right now, I have about 40 on my app that I consistently listen to.
It's a great way to rest my eyes while consuming some awesome media and analysis.  #datascienceanswer
So I figured, for my first Github Repo, so analyze some podcast data.

I decided on using data from itunescharts.net, a site that saves the itunes rankings for
the top 100 podcasts on the English charts.
I downloaded all the data from 2017, which can give us a look into how the podcast landscape
has changed in 2017.
My goal is to get as much qualitative information from this dataset.

The code I've written is meant to analyze groups of podcasts against one another, which the user chooses
at the beginning of the analysis.
I've structured the code into these sections:
-Input
-Analysis
-Outputs

For the first analysis, I analyzed one of my favorite podcast... distributor? (don't exactly know the correct term)
Anyways, it's CROOKED MEDIA!  
The guys beyond Pod Save America have created 5 podcasts in 2015.  They have all succeeded to great degrees, but I 
want to give some extra analysis that could hopefully help out Crooked in the future.

# Lets dive into it!
