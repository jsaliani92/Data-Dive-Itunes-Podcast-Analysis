# Crooked Media Report

Crooked Media is a media company started from the guys behind "Keepin it 1600", the highly popular political
podcast that emerged during the 2016 election.  The guys behind it (Jon, Jon and Tommy) were all former
Obama staffers who, at least in my opinion, have created a successful voice for the progressive base.

In 2017, under the Crooked Media umbrella, they've created five podcasts:

-Pod Save America
-Pod Save the World
-With Friends Like These
-Lovett Or Leave It
-Pod Save the People

Below are timeseries that show the days on which each of the podcasts have spent in the itunes top 100 rankings:
