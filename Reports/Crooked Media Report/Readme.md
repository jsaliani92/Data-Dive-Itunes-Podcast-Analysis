# Crooked Media 2017 Podcast Report (In-progress)

This report summarized my dive into the data around the podcasts from Crooked Media.  I look into how often they release content, what kind of audiences they've reached, how well they've faired on the iTunes rankings chart, and what Crooked Media can take away from this analysis.  I had two main goals with this analysis.  One: to see what this data is capable of telling us at this time about these podcasts and the company.  And two: to see if I can provide any significant insights to Crooked Media about their podcasts and how they've been received.  

Here are the sections of the report: 

### What is Crooked Meida? (Non-Data)
### What audiences have their podcasts reached?
### How have they done in the iTunes rankings?
### What are the key take aways we can see?

(and an FYI, if you're just interested in the analysis section, you can skip the first section.  But I highly recommend reading, it's an awesome section!!)

Together this gives a great overview on what Crooked Media has done this year and some insights they could use in future content creation.  Hope you enjoy!

# What is Crooked Media?

So before we get to the data, lets talk about Crooked Media the company.

Crooked Media is a progressive, podcast-driven media company started in early 2017 from the guys behind "Keepin it 1600" podcast.  The founders (Jon, Jon, Tommy and Dan) are all former Obama staffers who have created a successful voice for the progressive base.  I am a huge plan of all the podcasts they've released so far and am extremely excited for how the company grows in the coming years.  

The five Crooked Media podcasts are:

## Pod Save America

### Release Date
01/10/2017

### Hosts
Jon Favereau (@), Jon Lovett (@), Tommy Veitor (@) and Dan Phieffer (@)

### When does it come out?
Mondays and Thursdays each week

### Description
Twice a week, the founders of Crooked Media get together to have a "No Bullshit" conversation, exploring what the hell has been going on in politics over the past week, and featuring conversations with politicians, journalists and activists in hopes of inspiring others to act.  

### Julian's Review
I love this show; it's probably my favorite political news show right now.  Favs, the only member on both the Monday and Thursday shows, creates both a serious and light-hearted conversation where I'm both engaged on in the conversation, but I also learn pretty indepth coverage of topics I wouldn't normally explore.  This especially comes into play during the guest interviews, whether it be the Mayor of LA (Eric Garcetti) or founders of the Indivisible movement (). 


## Pod Save the World 

![alt text](https://github.com/jsaliani92/Itunes-Podcast-Chart-Analysis/blob/master/Images/Crooked_Media/Input/Pod_Save_The_World.png)

### Release Date
02/01/2017

### Host
Tommy Veitor (@)

### Description
Pod Save the World explores the 'world' of foreign policy, with Tommy interviewing guests whose careers have been about exploring the in and outs of international foreign policy.  He's covered experts on the recent French elections, the Russian state, and the negotiations with Iran over the nuclear deal.  And while these conversations are in-depth, Tommy is able to humanize both the topic their covering and the guest themself, giving them time to explain why their passionate about these issues and what effect the topics could actually have on the listeners life.  

### Julian's Review
While not a foreign policy buff, I've definitely learned  a lot about diplomacy through listening to this pod.  I really did think that these foreign policy decisions were made through extreme scrutiny and precisions.  But as Tommy says in his early episodes, it really comes down to a room of people making huge decisions with incomplete data and less-than ideal situations.


## With Friends Like These

### Release Date
02/22/2017

### Host
Anna Marie Cox (@)

### Description
With Friends Like These is about confronting an idealogy that I never thought of before listening to the show: "Discomfort is a tool of Oppresions". The show dives into the uncomfortable conversations we really don't want to have, but really should if we want to progress. Covering Tabboo subjects like white privilege, disabilities and gender identity, Marie Cox brings her listeners into some deep, intense, and awkward conversations.  This is probably my favorite podcast

### Julian's Review
This is probably my favorite podcast of the bunch.  It's conversations are tough but super rewarding for the listener, and I feel Marie Cox is both vulnerable and focused in all of the conversations.  I am beyond appreciative of what she's doing on her show.

## Lovett Or Leave It -

### Release Date
03/18/2017

### Host
Jon Lovett (@)

### Description
A gameshow podcast hosted by Jon Levett, the host and three guests play games and rant about the absurd week in poltical news.  The guests range from journalists to comedians, and is taped in front of a live audience.  It's like "Wait Wait, Don't Tell Me" but for political junkies.

### Julian's Review
This show is such a good time.  It brightens my week.  There are some great rants in here by Lovett and his guests.  If you want a jovial Saturday afternoon workout, this is your show.

## Pod Save The People -

### Release Date
04/27/2017

### Host
Deray Mckesson (@)

### Description
Pod Save the People dives into the world of local activism and social issue driven culture.  Mckesson interviews guests, covers the weekly news with Sam () and ___ (), and gives the listener advice on how to both get involved, and stay involved, with activism they care about.

### Julian's Review
My favorite thing about this podcast is the advice Mckesson's gives to the listener.  The rules are simple but powerful, and it gives me constant perspective on how to deal with the issue's I'm passionate about and stay active.  While this is the youngest of the Crooked Media shows, I'm excited to see what this one grows into over time!

Overall, I'm a huge fan of these podcasts and what Crooked Media has done this year.  It's impressive and I can't wait to see their new shows, but also how each of these shows grow over the coming years.  But now, let's dive into the fun stuff: what does the data say about Crooked Media?

## What audiences have their podcasts reached?

There are a couple ways to go about this question, but I chose to compared two metrics; the total number of iTunes rankings for each podcast, and the twitter reach of each of the podcast hosts.  I chose these two metrics because they give two indications on what audience the potential podcasts could reach.

### iTunes Review Totals
iTunes reviews are probably the best way a podcast supporter can voice thier support for their show.  After the end of any podcast one listens to, the host will recommend their listeners to make the effort, go into the iTunes app store and write a review for their show.  This is apparently a significant help in boosting the shows up in the iTunes ranking charts, which we will explore later.  This leads to futher exposure through the main iTunes podcast pages promoting the popular podcast for new users.  It gives a great idea of how passionate a podcast's audience can be.

### Twitter Host Followings
Knowing the host's social media following is key as it's one of, if not the most, primary way to advertise their show.  If host's with large audiences can bring in their Twitter followings to the podcast world, that is an easy and potentially quick way to grow an audience listenership right at the onset of the show.

Having defined what each variable is meant to show, let's look at the results of plotting them against one another:

Below are timeseries that show the days on which each of the podcasts have spent in the itunes top 100 rankings:

Looking at the timeseries, there are a few things to note.  Over 2017, these podcasts have been released in similar fashion, around a month between podcast releases.  Pod Save America, the podcast that's been out the longest, has been remarkably consistent in the top quarter of the rankings.  Being the brandname podcast, that is an incredible success to be in the top 25 throughout the whole year.  In fact, it's has the fifth highest average rank (5.75) podcast that has been on the chart at least a month.

The other podcasts, while not achieving that high degree of success, have also had successful runs.  This table breaks down the days and % of time each podcast has spent in the top sections of the rankings:
