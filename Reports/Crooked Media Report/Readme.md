# Crooked Media Report

Crooked Media is a media company started from the guys behind "Keepin it 1600", the highly popular political
podcast that emerged during the 2016 election.  The guys behind it (Jon, Jon and Tommy) were all former
Obama staffers who, at least in my opinion, have created a successful voice for the progressive base.

In 2017, under the Crooked Media umbrella, they've created five podcasts:

Pod Save America.
Pod Save the World.
With Friends Like These.
Lovett Or Leave It.
Pod Save the People.

Below are timeseries that show the days on which each of the podcasts have spent in the itunes top 100 rankings:

Looking at the timeseries, there are a few things to note.  Over 2017, these podcasts have been released in similar fashion, around a month between podcast releases.  Pod Save America, the podcast that's been out the longest, has been remarkably consistent in the top quarter of the rankings.  Being the brandname podcast, that is an incredible success to be in the top 25 throughout the whole year.  In fact, it's has the fifth highest average rank (5.75) podcast that has been on the chart at least a month.

The other podcasts, while not achieving that high degree of success, have also had successful runs.  This table breaks down the days and % of time each podcast has spent in the top sections of the rankings:
