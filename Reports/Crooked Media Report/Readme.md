# Crooked Media Report

This report summarized my dive into the data around the podcasts from Crooked Media.  I look into how often they release content, what kind of audiences they've reached, how well they've faired on the iTunes rankings chart, and what Crooked Media can take away from this analysis.  I had two main goals with this analysis.  One: to see what this data is capable of telling us at this time about these podcasts and the company.  And two: to see if I can provide any significant insights to Crooked Media about their podcasts and how they've been received.  Lets dive into it!

# What is Crooked Media?

So before we get to the data, lets talk about Crooked Media the company.

Crooked Media is a progressive, podcast-driven media company started in early 2017 from the guys behind "Keepin it 1600" podcast.  The founders (Jon, Jon, Tommy and Dan) are all former Obama staffers who have created a successful voice for the progressive base.  I am a
huge plan of all the podcasts they've released so far and am extremely excited for how the company grows in the coming years.  

The five podcasts Crooked Media has released are:

Pod Save America - The main show behind Crooked Media, twice a week PSA tries to create a "No Bullshit" conversation, exploring what the 
hell has been going on in politics over the past week, and featuring conversations with politicians, journalists and activists in hopes of 
inspiring others to act.

Pod Save the World - Hosted by Tommy Veitor, this podcast explores the 'world' of foreign policy, interviewing many guests
who have extensive experience working on FP in the White House.

With Friends Like These - Hosted by Anna Marie Cox, WFLT dives into the uncomfortable conversations we don't want to have.  From dealing
with taboo subjects like disabilities to blackness/white privalege, these conversations are deep, intense, awkward and fascinating.

Lovett Or Leave It - A gameshow podcast hosted by Jon Levett, the host and three guests play games and rant about the absurd week in 
poltiical news.  It's a fun time.

Pod Save the People - Deray Mckesson's first podcast dives into the world activism and social issue driven culture with deep dives
into the current and historical politics of progress.








Below are timeseries that show the days on which each of the podcasts have spent in the itunes top 100 rankings:

Looking at the timeseries, there are a few things to note.  Over 2017, these podcasts have been released in similar fashion, around a month between podcast releases.  Pod Save America, the podcast that's been out the longest, has been remarkably consistent in the top quarter of the rankings.  Being the brandname podcast, that is an incredible success to be in the top 25 throughout the whole year.  In fact, it's has the fifth highest average rank (5.75) podcast that has been on the chart at least a month.

The other podcasts, while not achieving that high degree of success, have also had successful runs.  This table breaks down the days and % of time each podcast has spent in the top sections of the rankings:
