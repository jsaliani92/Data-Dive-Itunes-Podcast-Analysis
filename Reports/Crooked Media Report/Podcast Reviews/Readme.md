![alt text](https://github.com/jsaliani92/Itunes-Podcast-Chart-Analysis/blob/master/Images/Crooked_Media/Input/Pod_Save_America.png)

### Release Date
01/10/2017

### Hosts
Jon Favereau (@), Jon Lovett (@), Tommy Veitor (@) and Dan Phieffer (@)

### When does it come out?
Mondays and Thursdays each week

### Description
Twice a week, the founders of Crooked Media get together to have a "No Bullshit" conversation around the weeks politics. They explore what the hell has been going on in politics (most specifically the Trump administration), while also featuring conversations with politicians, journalists and activists in hopes of inspiring their listeners to act.

### My Personal Review
I love this show; it's probably my favorite political news show out right now (sorry FiveThirtyEight Politics). Favs, the only Crooked member on both the Monday and Thursday shows, creates both a serious and light-hearted conversation, where I'm both engaged as a listener, but also learn quite a bit around many topics I wouldn't normally explore. This especially comes into play during the guest interviews, whether it be the Mayor of LA (Eric Garcetti) or founders of the Indivisible movement (). It's a great listen I would recommend to anyone whose interested in progressive politics.


## Pod Save the World

### Release Date
02/01/2017

### Host
Tommy Veitor (@)

### When does it come out?
Wednesdays every week

### Description
Pod Save the World explores the 'world' of foreign policy, with Tommy interviewing guests whose careers have been about exploring the in and outs of international foreign policy. He's covered experts on the recent French elections, the oppresive atmosphere of the Russian state, and what it was like to be in negotiations with Iran while crafting the nuclear deal. 

### My Personal Review
Not being a foreign policy buff myself, I've definitely learned a lot from this pod. While the conversations are in-depth, Tommy makes the topic relatable and humanizes whoever he's talking with, giving them time to explain why their passionate about these issues. Before this pod, I really thought that foreign policy decisions were made with the utmost confidence and put through extreme scrutiny. But as Tommy makes clear in his early episodes, it usually comes down to a room of people making huge decisions with incomplete data in less-than ideal situations.


## With Friends Like These

### Release Date
02/22/2017

### Host
Anna Marie Cox (@)

### When does it come out?
Fridays every week

### Description
With Friends Like These is about confronting this core belief: "Discomfort is a tool of oppression". Covering Tabboo subjects like white privilege, disabilities and gender identity, Marie Cox brings her listeners into some deep, intense, and (most importantly) awkward conversations.

### My Personal Review
This is probably my favorite podcast of the bunch. As someone who loves indepth, personal conversations, the 'real-ness' of this podcast is incredible. It's conversations are tough but super rewarding for the listener, and I feel Marie Cox is both vulnerable and focused as a host. I am beyond appreciative of what she's doing with this show.

## Lovett Or Leave It - 

![alt text](https://github.com/jsaliani92/Itunes-Podcast-Chart-Analysis/blob/master/Images/Crooked_Media/Input/Lovett_Or_Leave_It.png)

### Release Date
03/18/2017

### Host
Jon Lovett (@)

### When does it come out?
Saturdays each week

### Description
On this hilarious game show podcast, Jon and three guests rant about the absurdity in the past weeks political news cycle. From guessing which ridiculous pundit quotes are real to the all too famous "Rant wheel", this podcast is focused on the laughs, but brings along some solid substance. The guests range from journalists to comedians, and is taped in front of a live audience. It's basically "Wait Wait, Don't Tell Me", but for political junkies in need of a smile.

### My Personal Review
This show is such a good time. It brightens my week. There are some great rants in here by Lovett and his guests. If you want a jovial Saturday afternoon workout, this is your new show.


## Pod Save The People -

### Release Date
04/27/2017

### Host
Deray Mckesson (@)

### When does it come out?
Tuesdays most weeks

### Description
Pod Save the People dives into the world of activism and social issue driven culture. Mckesson has indept interviews with interesting guests (Cory Booker, Edward Snowden), covers the weekly news with Sam () and ___ (), and gives the listener advice on how to get involved (and stay involved) in their issues.

### My Personal Review
My favorite thing about this podcast is the advice Mckesson's provides to the listener. The rules are simple but powerful, and it gives me consistent perspective on how to deal with the issue's I'm passionate about. Since this is the youngest of the Crooked Media shows, I'm very excited to see what this one grows into over time!

###Overall
I'm a huge fan of these podcasts and what Crooked Media has done this year. It's impressive and I can't wait to see their new shows, but also how each of these shows grow over the coming years. 

But now, let's dive into the fun stuff: what does the data say about Crooked Media?
